feelWheel
=========
Based on the [Feeling Wheel](http://blogs.edweek.org/teachers/coaching_teachers/2014/03/cultivating_emotional_resilien.html) developed by Dr. Gloria Willcox, this app allows you to track your emotional state over time. Feelings are tracked on a per user basis and can be reviewed to discover trends.

Give the app a try [here](http://feelwheel.meteor.com/). It's built using the [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com) framework.

Future Plans
- Add reminder system so that users can schedule reminders for themselves to track their feelings
- Add charting view to history section (allow sorting by time/feeling)
- Improve mobile experience

NOTE:
Sometimes during peak usage times, Meteor's hosting can be a little unresponive. When visiting the app, if Meteor reports that the site is unavailable, try refreshing the page a few times.
