feelWheel
=========
Based on the [Feeling Wheel](http://blogs.edweek.org/teachers/coaching_teachers/2014/03/cultivating_emotional_resilien.html) developed by Dr. Gloria Willcox, this app allows you to track your emotional state over time. Feelings are tracked on a per user basis and can be reviewed to discover trends.

Give the app a try [here](http://cfpb-sdbewd-feelwheel.meteor.com/) (it's mobile friendly). It's built using the [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com) framework.

*Sometimes during peak usage times, Meteor's hosting can be a little unresponive. If Meteor reports that the site is unavailable, try refreshing the page.*
