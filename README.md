feelWheel
=========

Based on the Feeling Wheel developed by Dr. Gloria Willcox, this app allows you to track your emotional state over time. Feelings are tracked on a per user basis and can be reviewed to discover trends.

Future Plans
- Add reminder system so that users can schedule reminders for themselves to track their feelings
- Add charting view to history section (allow sorting by time/feeling)
- Improve mobile experience
